# Lab 01 - Deploy Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

## Lab scenario

You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that is implementing Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Your manager plans to onboard a few devices to provide insight into required changes to the Security Operations (SecOps) team response procedures.

You start by initializing the Defender for the Endpoint environment. Next, you onboard the initial devices for your deployment by running the onboarding script on the devices. You configure security for the environment. Lastly, you create Device groups and assign the appropriate devices.

>**Important:**  The lab Virtual Machines are used through different modules. SAVE your virtual machines. If you exit the lab without saving, you will be required to re-run some configurations again.

## Lab objectives (Duration: 60 minutes)
In this lab, you will perform the following:
- Task 1: Preparing the Microsoft Defender workspace
- Task 2: Initialize Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Task 3: Configure Roles
- Task 4: Configure Device Groups
