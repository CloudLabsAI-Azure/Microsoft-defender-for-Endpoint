1. In the **Scope tags** pane, keep everything as default and select **Next**.

    >**Note:** you can add tag information to specific devices. You can also use role-based access control and scope tags to make sure that the right admins have the right access and visibility to the right Intune objects. Learn more: Use role-based access control (RBAC) and scope tags for distributed IT in Intune.

1. In the **Assignments** pane, you can deploy or "assign" the profile to your user or device groups. Under **Included groups** select **Add groups** and selct the **Sg-IT** group that you created in Lab-01, select **Next**.
